# TICC
Sub-nanosecond time interval counter

Source files are contained in the "TICC" folder which is an Arduino
sketch folder.

The TICC is a "shield" mated to an Arduino Mega 2560 controller that allows very high resolution time interval measurements -- down to less than 60 picoseconds (trillionths of a second).

The software here runs on the Mega 2560 and controls the shield.  Measurement data is output in ASCII form on the Arduino's USB 
port.

The TICC will be available early in 2017 as an assembled product from http://tapr.org.
