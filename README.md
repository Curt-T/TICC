# TICC
Sub-nanosecond time interval counter

The TICC is a "shield" mated to an Arduino Mega 2560 controller that allows very high resolution time interval measurements -- down to less than 60 picoseconds (trillionths of a second).
The software here runs on the Mega 2560 and controls the shield.  Measurement data is output in ASCII form on the Arduino's USB port.
