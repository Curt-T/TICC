Errors on Rev. B board -- 24 April 2016

1.  Add 2.7k pullups on INTBA and INTBB. ADDED (at U4 and U6 inputs)

2.  Route STOPA and STOPB to Arduino Pins 6 and 7 respectively.  ADDED

3.  Add 100K pulldowns on STARTA and STARTB. ADDED (at SMA connectors)

Additional Changes for Rev. C:

4.  Add voltage translators for STOPA and STOPB

5.  Add jumpers so that channel A stop signal can come from stop gate,
    or directly from channel B SMA.  This would provide a single channel
    configuration that would allow more measurements/second but with a
    maximum time interval limited by the TDC chip.
