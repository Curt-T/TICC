TICC TO-DO LIST -- 25 November 2016

1.  Finish user interface (menu system) for configuration.
See TODO-UI.txt for details.

2.  Change as many variables/operations as possible from 64 bit to 32 bit.

3.  Verify correctness, and optimize, calculation functions in TDC7200.cpp
lines 146 to 168.

4.  Optimize serial (USB) output.  

a.  Find a more efficient way to print int64_t values given Arduino's 
inabiilty to natively handle that.  (Maybe split integer and decimal parts 
and print them separately, with a "." in between?)

b.  More important, see if buffering multiple results and sending in a burst
rather than each result as it's ready will improve throughput.  Latency in
output is OK as long as data is sent in the right order.

5.  Make better use of OO functions; in particular fix global vs. private
variables in TDCchannel.

6.  Lots of other clean-up.

7.  New functionality?
