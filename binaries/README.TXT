TICC Binaries

This directory contains a binary version of the TICC sketch compiled for
the Arduino Mega 2560.  It can be uploaded to the Arduino via USB using the 
"avrdude" software that is available for many platforms.

Included in this directory is a utility called "XLoader" which I obtained
from http://russemotto.com/xloader/.  It's an easy way to upload the
.hex file from a Windows machine (at least, it worked on mine).
